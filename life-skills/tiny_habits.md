# Tiny Habits Reflection

### Question 1:
**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

- The video talks about how to start small when forming habits. Here are the main points:
    "What i am talking about plant a tiny seed in the right spot and it will grow without coaxing the tiny seed"
  - Begin with tiny steps instead of waiting for big ideas.
  - The 3 key parts of behavior are **B = MAP**.
    - **M** = Motivation
    - **A** = Ability
    - **P** = Prompt (something that reminds you to do it)
  - Tiny habits are effective because:
    - They are quick and easy to do.
    - They are low-risk and easy to fix if you make a mistake.
    - They don’t need much willpower and build up over time.
  - Combine tiny habits with things you already do to make them stick.

### Question 2:
**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A, and P?**

- The B = MAP model helps with new habits by focusing on:
  - **M (Motivation):** Small habits don’t need a lot of motivation.
  - **A (Ability):** Break the habit into tiny, easy steps.
  - **P (Prompt):** Connect the new habit to something you already do as a reminder.
- Small actions are easy to fit into your schedule and easy to retry if you make a mistake.
